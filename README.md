This GitHub repository automates the customization and compilation of my resume to a PDF using LaTeX and GitHub Actions.

I've maintained my resume in LaTeX since my university days and chose to leverage GitHub Actions to improve its reproducibility and portability.

### Application Tracking Systems (ATS)?

Application Tracking Systems (ATS) are a suite of software tools used by HR, recruiters, and hiring managers to track and manage candidates throughout the talent acquisition pipeline. For the greatest visibilty during the hiring process, prioritize having clear and simple formatting to ensure readability and compatibility.

#### Resume Parser

Resume Parsers are software applications within an ATS that have the capability to extract key information from unstructured candidate resumes in various formats (`*.doc{,x}`, `*.pdf`, etc) and structure it into a standardized and searchable candidate database.
